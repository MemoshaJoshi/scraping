With Lilt  innovative  category-defining organizations like Intel  ASICS  WalkMe  and Canva are using AI technology to deliver multilingual  digital customer experiences at scale. Our founders  Spence and John met at Google working on Google Translate. As researchers at Stanford and Berkeley  they both worked on language technology to make information accessible to everyone. They were amazed to learn that Google Translate wasn’t used for enterprise products and services inside the company and left to start a new company to address this need – Lilt. At its core  Lilt has always been a machine learning company since its incorporation on March 6  2015. At the time  machine translation didn’t meet the quality standard for enterprise translations  so Lilt assembled a cutting-edge research team tasked with closing that gap. While meeting customer demand for translation services  Lilt has prioritized investments in Large Language Models  believing that this foundation was imperative to the future of enterprise translation. As a result  Lilt’s AI technology foundation is similar to ChatGPT and Google Translate  before our patented Contextual AI Engine  connector-first approach  and human-adapted feedback. Our team is located globally in San Francisco  Indianapolis  London  and Berlin  with hubs located in Washington DC  NYC  Boston  and Dublin.
